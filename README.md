## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze salary data and gain insights into gender-based salary disparities in different companies and positions. The code performs data processing, filtering, and visualization to facilitate exploration of the data.

## Installation

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or any Python environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.
2. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. The code relies on libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. If any of these libraries are missing, install them using the following command:
3. Upload the salary data file (in JSON format) to your Colab environment or provide the path to the file if it's already available (the files are in the path /dataFiles).

## Usage

1. Open the notebook and read the comments provided. The comments explain the purpose and functionality of each code block, making it easier to understand the analysis process.

2. Execute each code block sequentially. Make sure to follow the instructions and modify the code as needed, such as specifying the correct file paths or adjusting parameters.

3. As the code runs, it will perform data processing, filtering, and visualization steps. The output will include various graphs and summary statistics related to salary trends and gender disparities.

4. Review the generated graphs and analysis results to gain insights into the salary data. Use these findings to understand the patterns and trends in salary distributions across companies and positions.
